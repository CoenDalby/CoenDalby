### Final year of uni! 💻

Hi, my name is Coen Dalby. I'm wrapping up my BsC in Computer Science this year, and finally *committing* to really getting into git. 

For my dissertation, I'm working on an MTG Deck Analysis tool, where users can receive budget-adjusted card suggestions tuned to their needs, and view statistical analyses presented with appealing graphics. Here are some of the other modules I'm studying this year:

- Advanced Artificial Intelligence
- Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (both modules explore different Python ML libraries 🐍)
- Advanced Systems Programming (focusing on C languages)
- Distributed and Enterprise Software Development

In my free time, I've recently started working on a home server for hosting media and game servers, and I'm currently reading The Long Earth by Terry Pratchett + Stephen Baxter.
